The goal of this project is to design an SCOMP wall following program that enables the Amigobot to follow walls.

The design solution meets the following specications:

1. Use an eight bit velocity command where +127 (0x007F) is full speed forward, -127 (0xFF81)
is full speed reverse, and zero is stop.
2. Control position by reading the cumulative rotation counter of the wheel.
3. Use velocity feedback and position feedback from the wheels via the existing optical encoder
peripheral.
4. Provide a start button to begin execution after the robot is placed adjacent to a wall.
5. Use existing sonar and velocity control peripherals to issue commands to each wheel.
6. Travel parallel to a wall at a distance of 20 cm.
7. Select by switch or recompile to follow left or right walls.

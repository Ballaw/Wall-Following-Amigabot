\section{Management Plan}
The design will be executed according to the Gantt chart provided in Appendix A. 

\subsection{Contingency Plan}
In the event that the team cannot complete all tasks before the
deadline, the team will implement the state machine with the states 
``forward,''  ``adjust inward,'' ``adjust outward,'' ``inside turn,'' and
``outside turn.'' These requirements are fundamental to the wall following 
solution algorithm. Additional features outlined in \ref{xtras} will 
be implemented as time and resources permit.  

In the event that the presented algorithm does not adequately provide
a means for the Amigobot to follow a wall, a different, slower, and smoother
algorithm will be implemented. This backup program will eliminate the
need for the ``outside turn'' state and adjustment states, instead
continuously and smoothly adjusting the wheel velocities in forward
motion depending on
how far the robot is from the parallel wall. When there is a parallel
wall discontinuity, the measured distance will jump high and the robot
will adjust by increasing the outside wheel velocity, effectively
turning automatically. Inside turns will be accomplished by stopping
the robot when it is close to a forward obstacle, then rotating in
place until the front sensor, \(s_2\) or \(s_3\), no longer detects a
forward obstacle, whereupon forward motion will continue.

For future work, a useful development would be to show the moving states on the LCD display. This would allow for quicker and more effective debugging and would be a useful addition to the display. 

Another development would be to encode the green LEDs to show more functions as they are executed. The current design uses the green LEDs only as a loading bar for the \inside turn" state. Animating the LEDs for other states could aid in debugging purposes and improve the display. 

While this design takes the minimum of two adjacent sensory values, it could be edited to use weighted values of the sensors. Allowing some sensors to take precedence over others would allow the robot to accurately determine its orientation relative to the wall. 

Due to limited computational resources in assembly language, the measurement algorithm used to detect turns was not as accurate as desired. A major improvement to the program would be to compute a more accurate measurement algorithm.

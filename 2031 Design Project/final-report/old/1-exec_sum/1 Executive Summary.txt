\section{Executive Summary}The team designed a SCOMP wall following program for the Amigobot using sonar feedback to determine what velocity commands to send to each wheel. This program enables the robot to locate and travel parallel to a wall with inner and outer corners of \(90^\circ\). The solution to this challenge is a state machine program that executes commands based on the current state and the measured distance to the nearest wall. The state machine consists of four states: \forward motion," \inside turn," \adjust outward," and \adjust inward." In \forward motion," the robot moves forward full speed until it senses a wall in front of it or no wall is sensed. If a wall is sensed in front of the Amigobot, the program switches to the \inside turn" state, turns \(90^\circ\), and then proceeds to travel forward. If no wall is sensed, the Amigobot will adjust inward until it is parallel to the wall, and then continue on a straight path. A switch is used to toggle between following a wall on the left side or on the right side of the robot. The switch position determines turning direction and selects the ultrasonic sensors used to measure distance. Parallel motion to the wall is maintained by switching to \adjust outward" and \adjust inward" states, which corrected the robot trajectory if the measured distance was not within an acceptable range of \(20\pm1\)cm. Inputs to the state machine are ultrasonic sensory data. The outputs are velocity and direction instructions to the left and right wheels. During the final demonstration, the robot running this program was moderately successful in following the test course. It successfully navigated the wall on the right side and received an accuracy bonus. While the robot completted the course when following the wall on its left side, it did not receive an accuracy bonus and did not complete the course in the desired time frame.

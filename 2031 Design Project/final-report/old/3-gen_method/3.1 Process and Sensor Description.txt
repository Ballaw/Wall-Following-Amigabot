3.1 Process and Sensor Description

The wall following algorithm to be implemented follows the process found in Fig. 2.

--fig 2 flow chart of wall following algorithm--

A switch will be used to toggle between following the left wall and following the right wall.

The value of the switch determines which sensors are actively collecting data. The values of the following sensors will be used:
-Minimum values of sensor (s0 and s1) or (s4 and s5):
       Measure the distance to the closest parallel wall (Fig. 3).
-Sensor s2 or s3:
       Measure the distance to approaching wall (Fig. 5).
